    "Artificial Intelligence (AI): AI refers to the creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, and learning. AI is a broad field that encompasses many subfields, including machine learning and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML): ML is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data. ML algorithms can be supervised (where the algorithm is trained on labeled data) or unsupervised (where the algorithm learns to find patterns on its own). ML is used in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL): DL is a subset of ML that involves training deep neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex representations of data. DL algorithms are particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games like chess and Go. DL has enabled many recent breakthroughs in AI, such as self-driving cars and AlphaGo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science (DS): DS is a field that involves using statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. DS includes techniques from statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and data engineering. DS is used in many industries, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, to help organizations make data-driven decisions and improve their business processes.\n",

    "Supervised Learning: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, where the desired output is already known. The algorithm learns to make predictions or classify new data based on the patterns it has learned from the labeled data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector machines.\n",

    "Semi-Supervised Learning: Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. The labeled data is used to guide the learning process, while the unlabeled data is used to improve the quality of the learned representations. Semi-supervised learning can be useful when labeled data is expensive or difficult to obtain. Examples of semi-supervised learning algorithms include self-training, co-training, and multi-view learning.\n",
